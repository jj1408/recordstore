					<h3>Arcade Fire - Reflecktor</h3>
					<p>Arcade Fire's lush, imaginative 85-minute fourth album is a triumph, but not a victory lap; the band never sounds content enough for that. Instead, Reflektor is an anxious, occasionally downright paranoid album that asks big, barbed questions aimed not just at the man who may or may not be upstairs, but the more terrestrial gods of rock history, too.</p>

					<h3>Chromeo - Fancy Footwork</h3>
					<p>Follow-up to 2004's She's in Control again finds the electro-pop duo successfully mining the 80s for inspiration, incorporating talk boxes, 808s, canned percussion, and Prince-style atmospherics.</p>

					<h3>Culture Club - Colour by Numbers</h3>
					<p>Colour by Numbers does display a respect for pop history. When George debuted the ballad "That's the Way (I'm Only Trying to Help You)" at a sound check one day, he said, "Everyone said, 'Oh, it's really like Elton John.'"</p>

					<h3>David Bowie - Heroes</h3>
					<p>"Heroes" is the second installment of David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy. The trilogy, and "Heroes" in particular, show all the signs of an artist growing up, shaking off the trappings of capitalist ego and success, and searching for a soul instead. It often sounds as if Bowie is conducting chaos, smashing objects together to discover scarily beautiful new shapes.</p>

					<h3>Dire Straits - Love Over Gold</h3>
					<p>Love Over Gold is not just the title of Dire Straits' fourth album, it is a statement of purpose. In almost suicidal defiance of commercial good sense, singer-songwriter-guitarist Mark Knopfler has chosen to follow his muse, fashioning a collection of radically expanded epics and evocative tone poems that demand the listener's undivided attention.</p>

					<h3>Duran Duran - Rio</h3>
					<p>The band made most sense at its most successful. Rio isn't just front-loaded with some of the era's most bulldozing hits, it's still Duran's best shot at an artistic legacy. Their first album was made by a group shaking off its David Bowie and Japan crushes, Seven and the Ragged Tiger was a grand and flimsy folly: Rio is where the band's hunger for success really catalyzed its mix of rock, disco, and heartthrob pop. </p>

					<h3>Fleetwood Mac - Rumours</h3>
					<p>Upon its release in 1977, Rumours, became the fastest selling LP of all time, moving 800,000 copies per week at its height. Its success made Fleetwood Mac a cultural phenomenon and also set a template for pop with a gleaming surface that has something complicated, desperate, and dark resonating underneath.</p>

					<h3>Nirvana - Nevermind</h3>
					<p>Twenty years on, the album that changed the course of popular music is reissued in two deluxe versions. The enduring brilliance of the original is at this point beyond dispute, but the value of the demos, alternate mixes, and live cuts included on two new sets is debatable.</p>

					<h3>O. Children - O. Children</h3>
					<p>O. Children wants everyone to remember a time when The Cure and Joy Division ruled the land. A time when Goth rock was so good it made kids brood like nobodyâ€™s business. A time before all the hipsters became less depressed and more ironic and douchey. A time when atmospherics and the art of the brood were at an all-time high. A time called 1981.</p>
